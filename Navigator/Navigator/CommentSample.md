    /// Or numbered lists:
    ///
    /// 7. The numbers you use make no difference
    /// 0. The list will still be ordered, starting from 1
    /// 5. But be sensible and just use 1, 2, 3 etc…

    /// Code
    /// ----
    ///
    /// Use backticks for inline `code()`. Indentations of 4 spaces or more will create a code block, handy for example usage:
    ///
    ///     // Create an integer, and do nothing with it
    ///     let myInt = 42
    ///     doNothing(myInt)
    ///
    ///     // Also notice that code blocks scroll horizontally instead of wrapping.
